Covid Data Grabber

This is a cli and GUI tool to grab relevant Covid-19 (Sars-Cov2) viral information from the [data API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api) provided by The Atlantic. The grabber also has the ability to write to the (Trileaf Database)[https://github.com/trileaf-tech/data_collector] created and curated by Trileaf Technologies, LLC. 

Since this project does not contain any source files from the Trileaf Database (which are strictly confidential), free use of this code is allowed. 

For a more complete understanding of this project, see the Full Documentation for more details.

# Development

This project can be cloned and run locally, with the obvious exception of all server operations contained within `Server_Connection.py`, as the required packages will not be installable. However, one can easily modify the code found within to work with another MySQL server.
